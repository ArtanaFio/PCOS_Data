Project Title: Evaluating Efficacy: SQL Analysis of Clinical Trials for PCOS Treatment 

Overview: Data analysis using SQL to evaluate the efficacy of a hypothetical clinical trial studying the results of a new treatment to treat Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)

PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
A pharmaceutical company has developed a new treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and is conducting clinical trials to assess its efficacy. The company wants to analyze the clinical data collected from the trials to identify trends and insights that can help evaluate the effectiveness of the new treatment compared to existing treatments. Specifically, they are interested in using SQL to analyze patient data, treatment outcomes, and potential factors influencing treatment success or failure.


OBJECTIVES

    1. Analyze Patient Data: Extract and analyze patient demographics, medical history, and baseline characteristics from the clinical trial dataset.
    2. Assess Treatment Outcomes: Evaluate treatment outcomes such as changes in hormonal levels, menstrual regularity, ovulation, and symptom improvement among patients receiving the new treatment compared to standard treatments.
    3. Identify Trends and Patterns: Identify trends, patterns, and correlations in clinical data to understand factors influencing treatment efficacy, such as age, BMI, hormonal levels, Comorbidities, and treatment adherence.
    4. Compare Treatment Groups: Compare outcomes between patients receiving the new treatment and those receiving standard treatments or placebo, using statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
    5. Monitor Adverse Events: Monitor and analyze adverse events or side effects reported by patients during the trial to assess treatment safety and tolerability.
    6. Generate Insights and Recommendations: Generate insights and recommendations based on the analysis to help inform decision-making regarding the efficacy and safety of the new treatment for PCOS.


SQL ANALYSIS
   
    1. Patient Demographics: SQL queries to analyze demographics such as age, gender, BMI, ethnicity, and geographic distribution of patients participating in the clinical trial.
    2. Treatment Adherence: SQL queries to assess treatment adherence by analyzing prescription refills, medication dosages, and missed appointments among patients.
    3. Hormonal Levels: SQL queries  to analyze changes in hormonal levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen, LH/FSH ratio) before and after treatment administration.
    4. Symptom Improvement: SQL queries to assess improvements in PCOS symptoms such as hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities, and fertility outcomes.
    5. Adverse Events: SQL queries to identify and analyze adverse events reported by patients, including their frequency, severity, and potential associations with the new treatment.
    6. Comparative Analysis: SQL queries to compare treatment outcomes between the new treatment group and control groups, using statistical measures such as mean differences, confidence intervals, and p-values.


PROJECT GOAL

Provide the pharmaceutical company with valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of the new treatment, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and informd decision-making in healthcare for patients with PCOS.
